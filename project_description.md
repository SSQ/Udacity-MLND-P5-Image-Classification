## Project: Image Classification
### Project Description
In this project, you'll classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. 
### Project Overview
You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images
### Project Evaluation
Ensure you pass all points on the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/723/view).
## Software Requirements
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
As usual, weâ€™ll be using Conda to install TensorFlow. You might already have a TensorFlow environment, but check to make sure you have all the necessary packages.

OS X or Linux

Run the following commands to setup your environment:

    conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
    source activate tensorflow
    conda install pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook scipy scikit-learn
    pip install tensorflow

Windows

And installing on Windows. In your console or Anaconda shell,

    conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
    activate tensorflow
    conda install pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook scipy scikit-learn
    pip install tensorflow

## Code
Template code is provided in the `image_classification.ipynb` notebook file.
